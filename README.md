# ARFI
Matlab function for simulating displacement sensitivity for different MEG durations and HIFU offset times as well as ranges of mechanical and MR tissue constants.

displSNR.m is a function that takes ranges of tissue mechanical and MR constants as well as MEG type (bipolar or tripolar) as an input and simulates ARF-related mean displacement SNR

Example.m is code that shows how to use the function
